For $3 a game, I would play. When running the simulation, the average amount you win
is usually close to 5. This being said, you still have good odds of making a profit of at least
$2 on average per game. Additionally, the max won that I received was close to $70, 
which is a great best case outcome for a $3 buy-in.
